# react-configurable-chatbot
Based on [React Chatbot Kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chatbot-kit), I have coded certain keywords to trigger a specific response coming from a JSON endpoint. This package relies on the `react`, `prop-types`,and `styled-components` peer-dependency packages to be already installed and set up in your project.
